ADCD ZOS 1.9 18 is a distribution of z/OS 2.2 that can be used with z Systems Development and Test Environment, a software solution that enables developers to create, edit, debug, and test applications for IBM ZÂ® systems on a local Linux system. ADCD ZOS 1.9 18 contains various z/OS products and subsystems, such as CICS, IMS, DB2, and WebSphere Application Server.
  
In this article, we will show you how to download and install ADCD ZOS 1.9 18 for z Systems Development and Test Environment, following the steps from the IBM documentation[^1^] [^2^]. You will need an activated license key file to install the system resident volumes of the z/OS ADCD. The same license key file that entitles you to run z Systems Development and Test Environment also entitles you to install a z/OS ADCD.

## Step 1: Download the ADCD ZOS 1.9 18 volumes
  
The first step is to download the ADCD ZOS 1.9 18 volumes from the IBM website. You can find the download information technote at [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21682519](http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21682519). You will need to sign in with your IBM ID and password.
  
The download information technote contains a table that describes what volumes can be downloaded with this distribution and their general contents. To reduce the amount of disk space you use, you can download and install only the volumes that are required and the subsystems you use.
  
At a minimum, install all the base z/OS products, which are all the volume images that are not associated with the following products: CICS 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3; IMS versions 13, 14, and the IMS Utility pack; DB2 versions 10 and 11; WebSphere Application Server versions 8.0 and 8.5.
  
This set of volumes includes the base z/OS products:
  
- B2RES1, B2RES2, SARES1
- B2SYS1, B2CFG1
- B2USS1, B2USS2
- B2PRD1, B2PRD2, B2PRD3
- B2DIS1, B2DIS2
- B2PAGA, B2PAGB, B2PAGC
- B2KAN1
- B2BLZ1

The download information technote also provides instructions on how to download the volumes using FTP or HTTP protocols.
  
## Step 2: Install the ADCD ZOS 1.9 18 volumes
  
The second step is to install the ADCD ZOS 1.9 18 volumes on the instance that runs z Systems Development and Test Environment. You will need to use the Z1091\_ADCD\_install command to install these system resident volumes. This command requires access to an activated license key file, either on a locally attached USB hardware device, or on a product license server or a license manager with connectivity to the instance that does the installation.
  
The IBM documentation[^1^] [^2^] assumes that the two MVS IPL volume images, with file extension ZPD, are downloaded into the directory structure /home/ibmsys1/z1090. The remaining virtual 3390 volumes, with file extension gz, are downloaded into the directory structure /home/ibmsys1/z1090/disks. Any z Systems Development and Test Environment scripts are assumed in /home/ibmsys1/z.

The directory structure /home/ibmsys1/z1090/disks was used because that directory structure complies with the structure created when you start the z Systems Development and Test Environment.
